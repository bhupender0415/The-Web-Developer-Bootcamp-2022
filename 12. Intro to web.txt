1. What is the Web?

The Web is a subset of the internet.
Like every other computer network out there, 


The Web is made up of two main components: 

1. the web browser client -> client requests the data

2. the web server -> server shares or serves its data

To achieve this, 

the two parties have to establish an agreement. 

That agreement is called the "Application Programming Interface" or in short, the API.
