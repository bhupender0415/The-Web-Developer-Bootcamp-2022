HTML5

The term HTML5 is essentially a buzzword that refers to a set of modern web technologies.
This includes the HTML Living Standard, along with JavaScript APIs to enhance storage, 
multimedia, and hardware access.

You may sometimes hear about "new HTML5 elements", or find HTML5 described as a new version of HTML.
HTML5 was the successor to previous HTML versions and introduced new elements and capabilities to the language on top of the previous version, 
HTML 4.01, as well as improving or removing some existing functionality. However, as a Living Standard HTML now has no version.
