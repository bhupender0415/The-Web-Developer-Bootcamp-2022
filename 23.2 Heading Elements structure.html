    <h1>Blockchain</h1>
    <p>A <b>blockchain </b>is a type of Digital Ledger Technology (DLT) that consists of growing list of records, called
        blocks, that are securely linked together using cryptography.[1][2][3][4] Each block contains a cryptographic
        hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where
        data nodes are represented by leafs). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was
        created. Since each block contains information about the block previous to it, they effectively form a chain
        (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently,
        blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be
        altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks</p>

    <p>A blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in
        2008[6] to serve as the public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous
        work by Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer.[7] The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown to
        date. The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the
        double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has
        inspired other applications[3][2] and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by
        cryptocurrencies. The blockchain may be considered a type of payment rail.[8]</p>

    <p>Private blockchains have been proposed for business use. Computerworld called the marketing of such privatized
        blockchains without a proper security model "snake oil";[9] however, others have argued that permissioned
        blockchains, if carefully designed, may be more decentralized and therefore more secure in practice than
        permissionless ones.[4][10]</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems
        Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."[11] Further work on a cryptographically
        secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.[4][12] They wanted to
        implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave
        Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document
        certificates to be collected into one block.[4][13] Under their company Surety, their document certificate
        hashes have been published in The New York Times every week since 1995.[14]</p>
