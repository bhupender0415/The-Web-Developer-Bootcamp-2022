</head>
<body>
<p>This HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields. </p>
<p>Paragraphs are block-level elements, and notably will automatically close if another block-level element is parsed before the closing tag. See "Tag omission" below.</p>
