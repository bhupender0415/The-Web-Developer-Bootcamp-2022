What are Semantic Elements?

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Examples of non-semantic elements: 

                <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: 

                <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.


In HTML there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page:  

<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>
